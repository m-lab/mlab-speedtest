**support@measurementlab.net**

## Scope

This repository contains the front-end source code for [speed.measurementlab.net](https://speed.measurementlab.net). The site is a static web application — it does not handle user authentication, store personal data server-side, or manage sensitive credentials directly.

Speed test measurements are conducted client-side and transmitted to M-Lab's infrastructure. For security concerns related to M-Lab's broader infrastructure or data handling, see [measurementlab.net/privacy](https://www.measurementlab.net/privacy/).

## Supported Versions

Only the latest version deployed to [speed.measurementlab.net](https://speed.measurementlab.net) (tracking the `main` branch) is actively maintained.
